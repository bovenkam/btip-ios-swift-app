# Introduction
This Xcode project serves as a tutorial for how to get started integrating the Braze iOS SDK.

The framework of this project (Swift) is already built out such that all that needs to be added is the Braze SDK and relevant methods to start logging user data. You don't need to know much about Swift to get going here.

# Instructions
1. Clone or download the repo to your computer.
2. Follow along with the provided deck (referenced in the associated Confluence page)
3. After the SDK is initialized, you will need to use your resources to identify which Braze methods need to be called and inserted in the appropriate places.
